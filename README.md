===Time management app (module 1)===

Requirements: This project requires the following software:
	      Visual studio 2019, 
	      In order to run the software.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
===Description===
Time mannagement app is a... 
wpf application that allows the user to do the following:
-- it allows the user to enter the details of the modules they are doing and display them in 
a table for them to see what they have entered
--it allows for the user to calculate their study hours and how much of it is remaining

To use the program, you first have to download the Project folder and store the folder. 
Then, next, to open up the Visual studio solution file in the project folder.
Select the start button on top, if you wish to start the program.
Remember: use the stop button in visual studio to end the program, if the "X"
on the top right corner does not end the program.

how to use:
it is fairly simple. all you have to do is enter the values being asked for. 
e.g if the program asks for a number, you enter as required.
and if the program asks for anything else, it will most likely require letters, e.g.
"Module code". 

Everything is similar to the first one with some 
minor changes...
NEW note: modules entered and study hours used to be in different pages but now 
they are on the same page in order to better store data in the sql database created.
-before seeing the home page you must first login, if you are new,
click register. 
-The logout now takes users back to login page.

Also note that when entering decimals, 
they must be represented with a coma ("3,2") and not with a dot ("3.2"). if you are 
required to do so that is.

if you need more guidance on how to use the program, I advice watching the how to use video.
